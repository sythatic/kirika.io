        <p>
            Ozer was unable to even fathom the idea that there could be an individual more powerful than himself.
        </p>
        <p>
            While Ozer denied any connection to the Arcturan lineage, he still followed many ancient Arcturan traditions in his day to day life.
        </p>
        <p>            
            Ozer was fascinated with Jacob, not only for his inherent political prowess but also because he viewed him as, and encouraged Jacob to use the teachings of both. It was Ren's raw, untamed strength in the Force that led Ozer to believe his student could achieve a level of power comparable to that of Ren's late grandfather, the Arcturan Lord Darth Vader. As such, Ozer believed that he had never had a student that showed more promise before Ren.
        </p>
        <p>            
            He was a secretive, enigmatic figure who coveted the arcane lore of his ancestors, the Holoshans.<a id="footnote" href="#footnotes">[1]</a>.
            
            During his early career, Ozer served as one of the primary advisors to Aroura and Luna and helped to forge the "rigged-to-fail" Hyrenian Imperial Republic. Using the sisters' youthful ignorance to his advantage and his razor sharp charisma to appease his colleagues, Ozer ensured that the government had a secret "back door" for him to usurp power when the time was right. 
            
            He was both wise and cunning, having risen to power by undermining the Hyrenian Empire's leading officials through guile. He was a master at manipulation, he regulary used teenagers and young adults as tools to commit atrocities on his behalf. Relying on their youthful naivity and physical capability.
                      
            Ozer's intelligent, sophisticated, and often calm demeanor masked his more sinister qualities such as cruelty, arrogance, egotism, and narcissism. He was a terrifying, monstrous individual who possessed a dark nature. Depending on the situation, Ozer's demeanor could shift from calm to aggressive without warning.
            
            Despite his formidability, Ozer feared one thing. The return of Aurora, the last living Arcturan Celestial. If she ever returned from exile, she would herald the rise of a new generation of Celestial teachings. He knew that the fallen Celestial monarch wasn't weak but misguided.  
            
            
            He regarded the possible return Celestial technology as a threat to his designs and, therefore, plotted to destroy it entirely by killing the last Celestial.
            
               Despite Ozer's hatred for the Arctruans, he still respected them. 
            
            He was known for his unwillingness to meet face to face with subordinates and often communicated solely by a hologram transmitted from his throne at Tenebris Castle, only interacting personally with specific targets.
            




            by using the boy's desperate need for a teacher to his advantage.
            

            Although he regarded Giovanni as a "Slow, stupid, oaf," Ozer recognized the general's usefulness and believed that even a person's flaws could serve a purpose if properly manipulated.
            
            Despite holding a low opinion of Giovanni, the Supreme Leader saw the incredible potential of his children. Ozer viewed The Grandon childeren as easy targets, as he knew that their father's ego would only be fueled by the opportunity presented to them.
            
            In addition, he shared Ozer's underling's belief in the necessity of a powerful military force. Giovanni took to overseeing the militarization of the Hyrenian Empire, Ozer often sanctioned his military strategies and showed approval for his logistical innovations. This lead to Giovanni's promotion to 
        </p>
        <p>            
            Disappointed by Jacob's failure to make it to the Arcturan Wellspring, the Supreme Leader berated him as a failed apprentice who was unworthy... In light of Jacob's failure, Ozer began to doubt whether his disciple would ever truly be fit to take his place. As such, he also considered casting Jacob aside for good in favor of his sister, Grace.
        </p>
        <p>            
            Additionally, Ozer was cruel as well as a predator, who identified weakness and exploited it, as demonstrated by how Ozer dominated not just the Hyrenian Government but specifically Jacob and Grace, making him a brutal tyrant. He particularly enjoyed using his powers to manipulate the minds of his subordinates and subject them to conditioning, picking apart their courage and resolve slowly over time.
        </p>
        <p> 
            
        </p>
        <p>            
            Ozer's appearance was frail, with heavily scarred skin and a mutilated appearance. His twisted figure and extensive scarring were a result of the severe injuries he sustained during the destruction of Arbiters Henge.
            
            Because of his physical frailties, which left him well past his prime in terms of physical strength, he relied on material comforts such as ornate silver-galladium khalat robes and slippers to deal with his ailing body. Without the aid of celestial magic, he would be in a constant state of pain due to his advanced age and wounds and he could not defend himself in a physical fight.
