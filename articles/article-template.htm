        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Jacob Grandon, infamously known by his moniker, Omni, stands as one of the most formidable and complex characters in the Tales of Seven universe.</p>

        <p>nemo cook=omni, emloys nimdoc, mangle, zimmerman. uses tech to overthrow magic/ozer. </p>

        <p>Born to Giovanni and Ursa, and the elder brother of Grace.</p> 
                
        <p>From a young age, Jacob displayed</p> 
                
        <p>He developed into a technical genius and historian, who devoted his free time to the development of cutting-edge weapons and technology in seclusion.</p> 
                
        <p>Lacking natural magical abilities, Jacob relied on his keen intellect and technological skills to invent remarkable gadgets.</p>  
                
        <p>Despite his apparent destiny for greatness, Jacob's talents were not nertured by his peers. He was consistently exploited for his abilities by those of higher social status without offering any recognition or validation.</p> 
                
        <p>his unhealthy practice of self-isolation lead him to grow fearful of forging close connections with others. He was terrified of caring about people and then losing them.</p> 
                
        <p>Engineered the first "Mirror Mask"</p> 
                
        <p>As he grew older, Jacob's superiors, mainly Dorian Ozer and his father Giovanni,</p> 
                
        <p>ultimately, the constant abuse and neglect pushed him to employ his talents for evil.</p> 
                
        <p>Convinced that his actions served a greater purpose. </p> 
                   
        <p>----developed his Mark 1 galladium armor  </p> 
                 
        <p>He began identifying himself as "Omni", carrying out his vicious agenda through proxies and/or his new alter-ego. Disregarding societal norms, he sought to establish himself as the unrivaled power in the world. </p> 
                     
        <p>----After establishing himself, he completed the final revision of his armor, Mark 3 Biladium Armor.</p> 
                
        <p>Omni was notorious for his appearance, wearing a sleek metallic, mirror-finish helmet that completely shrouded his head, a dark royal blue suit, polished black shoes, and silver liquid metal gauntlets that complemented his helmet. He was also known for being very cold-hearted and strict, with a professional demeanor that many considered to be over the top.</p> 
                                                            
        <p>Over time, Jacob's transformation into Omni was complete. Driven by a twisted ambition to become the world's ultimate power through cunning and technological dominance and a fervent desire to eradicate the world of its tragic magical history. He believed that his actions were for the greater good</p> 
                
        <p>Beneath his ruthless and austere exterior, Omni's unsettling features included a pale complexion and hair as white as snow with a slight silvery zeal, cold grey empty eyes, and dark circles under his tired eyes. A lot of his odd appearance was a result of him keeping himself inside his many layers of "protection". </p> 
                 
        <p>Omni's undoing came when he was forced to recognize his disassociation, compelling him to confront his true identity, not as Omni, but as Jacob. </p> 
                
        <p>Ridley and Nahla, the first individuals to perceive his vulnerability, saw him not as an enemy but as a fellow human grappling with life, existence, and the enigmatic cosmos. Instead of forsaking their defeated adversary, they acknowledged him as an equal, offering him empathy and understanding.</p> 

        <p>Jacob is a character with great potential and inherent talent, but his journey is marked by internal struggles, the search for identity, and the battle between the light and dark sides within him. Throughout his story, Jacob's transformation into Omni and his subsequent actions are heavily influenced by the manipulations of Dorian Ozer. </p>

        <p>Ozer is a cunning and powerful figure who recognizes the potential in Jacob and seeks to exploit it for his own nefarious purposes. Ozer manipulates and twists Jacob's desires and fears, molding him into a powerful weapon to further his own agenda. In this way, Ozer serves as a catalyst for Jacob's descent into darkness.</p>

        <p>As the story progresses, Jacob's internal conflict becomes more pronounced. He struggles with the darkness within himself and the consequences of his actions as Omni, while also trying to reconcile his past and the person he once was. Jacob's journey leads him to grapple with his true identity, legacy, and the expectations placed upon him.</p>

        <p>The dynamic between Jacob and Ozer is marked by tension, power struggles, and the constant push and pull of control. As Jacob becomes more aware of Ozer's manipulations, he starts to question his loyalties and the path he has chosen. This internal struggle leads to a breaking point, and eventual rebellion against Ozer.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, Jacob's story is one of redemption and growth. Through confronting his past, understanding the true nature of his relationship with Ozer, and coming to terms with his own identity, Jacob manages to break free from the darkness that has consumed him. In doing so, he overcomes the hold Ozer has on him and charts a new course for his future.</p>
                    
        <p>Jacob's transformation into Omni represents a descent into madness fueled by the mistreatment endured by himself and those around him.</p> 
                
        <p>As Omni, Jacob's descent into madness and his ultimate redemption demonstrate the complexities of human nature. Although he succumbed to darkness, Jacob's embrace of his genuine self serves as a beacon of hope for those who have lost their way.</p>
